# City Pathfinding Project

## Overview

This project implements a **pathfinding system** for Turkish cities using two popular graph traversal algorithms: **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. The system includes a **GUI application**, **command-line interaction**, and a robust backend to handle data processing and algorithm execution.

The system provides users with:
- **Shortest paths** between cities using BFS and DFS.
- Detailed **execution times** and **path lengths** for comparison.
- A **visual interface** for easy interaction.

## Features

- **Graph Representation**: Turkish cities are represented as **nodes** in a graph, with distances between them as **edges**.
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Both **BFS** and **DFS** algorithms are implemented for pathfinding.
- **Custom Data Structures**: Includes custom implementations of **stack** and **queue** interfaces for flexibility and performance.
- **GUI**: A user-friendly interface to select cities and view results.
- **Command-Line Interaction**: Direct access to algorithms via terminal for advanced users.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher.
- **Swing Library**: Included in the Java Standard Edition for GUI development.
- **CSV File**: A properly formatted CSV file representing the adjacency matrix for the cities.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Open the project** in your preferred Java IDE.

3. Ensure the **CSV file** containing the adjacency matrix is in the **project root directory**.

4. Run the `Main.java` file for **command-line interaction** or `GUI.java` for the **graphical interface**.

## Usage

### GUI

1. Launch the GUI application by running `GUI.java`.
2. Select the **start** and **end cities** from the dropdown menus.
3. Click **Run BFS** or **Run DFS** to calculate the shortest path.
4. View the results in the **output area**.

### Command-Line

1. Run the `Main.java` file.
2. Enter the **start** and **end cities** when prompted.
3. View the **shortest path**, **path length**, and **execution time** for BFS and DFS in the terminal.
4. Enter **Q** to quit the application.

## Custom Data Structures

- **MyQueueInterface**: Defines methods for **queue** operations, such as **enqueue**, **dequeue**, and **peek**.
- **MyStackInterface**: Defines methods for **stack** operations, such as **push**, **pop**, and **peek**.

## Algorithms

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Ensures the **shortest path** in terms of the number of edges.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Explores deeper paths before backtracking, which may not always yield the shortest path.

## Future Improvements

- Extend support for **weighted graphs** in BFS and DFS.
- Implement additional graph traversal algorithms, such as **Dijkstra's** or **A\***.
- Provide **analytics** and **visualizations** for the graph structure.

## Note

This project is intended for **educational purposes** and **personal use**. If you find it helpful, a mention or credit would be appreciated.
